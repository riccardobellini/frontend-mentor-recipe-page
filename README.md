## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

This is the first time I managed to use CSS grid layout, to add top and bottom margins to the card when in Desktop layout and remove them in Mobile.

### Continued development

I will surely explore further the CSS grid, since it's extremely powerful but also more complex than Flexbox
